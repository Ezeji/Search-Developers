The data is shown on a horizontal linearlayout of the list item. On clicking a linearlayout, it pushes inwardly to display in addition the user's
github url and a share-button. Further click on the share-button activates a share intent to enable the developer's details (Image,Profile name and Github url) to be shared
on a social media platform.
