# Intermediate-Track-Challenge

Hello there,

I am Franklin Ezeji, a lover of technology to solve human problems. I develop desktop and mobile applications for now using c#,mySql,java and xml. Hoping to explore further.

The changes made is simply the addition of codes to see that the android app is able to retrieve images and names from the API used (Github API).
